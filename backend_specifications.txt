Backend Development Overview

The backend will be responsible for handling user authentication, managing posts, scheduling tasks, and integrating with third-party social media APIs. The backend should be built using Node.js and Express, with Firebase as the database.

Key Components and Tasks

1. User Authentication
   - Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication or OAuth 2.0.
   - Create endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.
   - Ensure secure handling of user credentials and tokens.

2. Database Structure
   - Set up Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database to store:
     - Users Collection: Store user profiles, connected social media accounts, and preferences.
     - Posts Collection: Store drafts, scheduled posts, and timestamps.
     - Notifications Collection: Store notification schedules tied to posts.
   - Define data models and relationships between collections.

3. Post Management
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on posts:
     - Create Post: Endpoint to save new posts (drafts).
     - Read Posts: Endpoint to retrieve user posts (drafts and scheduled).
     - Update Post: Endpoint to edit existing posts.
     - Delete Post: Endpoint to remove posts.
   - Implement validation for post content, ensuring compliance with platform-specific guidelines (e.g., character limits).

4. Scheduling Posts
   - Integrate a job queue (e.g., BullJS) for scheduling tasks:
     - Create a job for each scheduled post to publish it at the specified time.
     - Ensure tasks are resilient, with retry mechanisms for failed jobs.
   - Implement endpoints to manage scheduled posts (e.g., rescheduling, canceling).

5. Notifications
   - Implement a notification system to remind users before a scheduled post is published.
   - Create endpoints to manage notification settings and schedules.

6. Integration with Social Media APIs
   - Integrate with third-party social media APIs (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) for publishing posts:
     - Create endpoints to handle the connection and disconnection of social media accounts.
     - Implement functionality to publish posts to connected accounts.
   - Ensure compliance with each platform's API guidelines and rate limits.

7. Analytics (Optional)
   - If implementing post analytics, create endpoints to retrieve engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) for published posts.
   - Store and manage analytics data in the database.

8. Testing and Documentation
   - Write unit tests for all API endpoints and critical functionalities.
   - Document the API using tools like Swagger or Postman for easy reference.
   - Ensure that the backend is well-commented and follows best practices for maintainability.

Development Workflow
- Start with user authentication and database setup.
- Implement post management features next.
- Add scheduling functionality and integrate the job queue.
- Finally, implement social media API integrations and analytics features.
